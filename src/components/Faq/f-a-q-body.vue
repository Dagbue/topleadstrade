          </summary>
          <p>
            he term “instant” indicates that a transaction will be carried out within a few seconds without manual
            processing by our financial department specialists. Please note that although it's instantly processed
            on our side, your deposit or withdrawal requests may take some time to be processed on the payment
            system provider's side.

          </summary>
          <p>
            On TLT' side all withdrawal requests are processed instantly. Your withdrawal request is then sent to
            our card processors and your bank, and the whole process can take from 1 to 30 business days for the funds
            to be reflected in your bank account depending on the bank and country you are located in.

          </summary>

            You must use your own personal payment accounts for deposits and withdrawals. We will not accept direct
            payments or payments to or from third parties. All the information you need regarding transactions
            can be found in your Personal Area. If your deposit payment method is unavailable during withdrawal,
            contact the Support tea. Occasionally, some payment systems may be turned off due to maintenance.

            it within 24 hours. Bear in mind, it may take your bank or payment service a little longer. We can’t be
            held liable for any deposit or withdrawal processing delays that are caused by payment systems. We reserve
            the right to change the processing time for deposits and withdrawals without prior notification.

            Is TLT PCI DSS compliant?
          </summary>
          <p>
            TLT is independently audited and meets all PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
            requirements for secure payments. This includes efficient data management, bespoke security with providers,
            data encryption, network monitoring, and regular vulnerability scans, safeguarding users against potential
            data breaches and fraud during bank card transactions.

          <summary>
            What security types are available?
          </summary>
          <p>TLT accounts offer several security types to verify the identity of the account owner and protect
            sensitive information. These security types include phone, email, and TOTP
            (available only in certain countries). Each account action requires a six-digit code, sent to the chosen
            security type, to be entered for confirmation. Only one security type can be active at a time, but changes
            can be made under certain conditions. Additionally, a unique alphanumeric Support PIN is generated to act
            as the highest level of security. This PIN is used to verify the account owner when contacting support,
            ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to the true account owner.</p>

            How do I protect myself from fraudulent activity?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Be mindful while engaging in secure trading. Guard against fraud by not sharing sensitive details like
            passwords, IDs, or TLT security types. TLT reps never ask for such info via text, email, or social
            media. Don't leave your Personal Area unattended, carry out TLT activities outside the Personal Area,
            or transfer funds to unknown accounts. Beware of unknown links and don't share passwords. If you suspect
            fraud, contact TLT immediately via live chat or email. Be cautious of unexpected TLT messages; when
            in doubt, reach out to support. If you've unintentionally shared private information, change your password
            immediately.
